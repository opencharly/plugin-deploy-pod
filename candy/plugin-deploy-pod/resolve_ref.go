// resolve_ref.go — the deploy-key→(box-name, image-ref) resolution the pod config/start paths do,
// resolved PLUGIN-SIDE (the deploy-config-resolve reverse-leg SEAM COLLAPSE, #55 Cone A Unit 2).
// The former host seam and its three host-side resolvers (charly/deploy.go, charly/host_build_pod_config_seams.go)
// are DELETED — see the CHANGELOG for the retired names. This file self-resolves using only what a
// plugin can reach placement-invariantly:
//   - the per-host deploy overlay via the EXISTING "pod-config-load-deploy" seam (loadDeploy → dc),
//   - the PROJECT fallback via the shared loaderkit.LoadUnifiedViaExecutor helper + the
//     "deploy-plugins-connect" seam's project dir (the SAME plugin-side loader path
//     candy/plugin-fleet's resolveTreeViaLoader uses), and
//   - kit.ResolveShellImageRef / kit.LocalImageExists (pure).
// Byte-for-byte the former host resolvers' two-tier semantics: per-host Image (DeployKey then bare
// key) → project Fleet[box].Image → the key itself; and the add_candy-overlay resolved_image
// preference over the base-name resolution (DeployKey then bare key), gated on the overlay image
// actually existing locally.

// qualifyImageRef applies the registry-qualification rule to the ref resolveDeployRef produced,
// returning the ref `charly config` renders the quadlet from. It is a PURE function of the values
// runConfig already holds — deliberately, so the rule below is unit-testable without an executor
// (the pre-fix form computed both its operands from executor-backed calls, which is a large part
// of why it shipped broken).
//
// The rule: registry-QUALIFY a short ref, UNLESS
//   - the operator supplied an explicit ref via the deploy entry's `image:` field (Pattern B —
//     arbitrary deploy-key + version-pin, /charly-core:deploy "Two supported deploy patterns"):
//     imageRef is already fully-qualified and pinning to that exact tag is the whole point; or
//   - imageRef IS this deploy's persisted add_candy overlay: the overlay is a LOCAL-only
//     `<deploy-name>-overlay:<hash>` tag (no registry segment, so LooksLikeFullRef cannot protect
//     it), and prefixing the registry would throw the overlay away and deploy the BASE image.
//
// Two invariants this rule MUST keep, BOTH of which the pre-fix form violated:
//
//  1. It compares REFS to REFS. The pre-fix form bound resolveDeployRef's FIRST return — the box
//     NAME — and compared it to a ref, so the overlay test was always false and the persisted
//     overlay was always discarded.
//
//  2. It QUALIFIES the ref it already has; it never RE-RESOLVES through the deploy-key API. The
//     pre-fix form re-resolved via resolveDeployRefLocal(deployBoxName, …), and a box NAME is not
//     a deploy KEY: that lookup reads whichever SIBLING deployment happens to be named after the
//     shared base box, then (tag empty) resolves the base box's label family, where every sibling
//     deployment's alias tag competes.
//
// Together those made every add_candy overlay pod deploy run some other deployment's image —
// operator deploys as much as check beds.
