// Package deploypod is the charly DEPLOY plugin serving the `pod`
// deploy SUBSTRATE — `target: pod` (the DEFAULT substrate: a deployment run as a
// container image via quadlet/podman). It is the pod-substrate sibling of
// candy/plugin-deploy-vm: charly host-builds it and serves it OUT-OF-PROCESS over
// go-plugin gRPC (LocalTransport), then the host's plugin-side deploy target Invokes it
// (OpExecute) with the deployment's InstallPlan VIEWS + a venue descriptor, and the host's executor
// served on the broker.
//
// Unlike deploy:vm (whose plugin WALKS the plan inside the guest), pod bakes its install
// steps INTO the image at BUILD time. The pod lifecycle (this plugin's lifecycle.go, M4 + P11c)
// builds the overlay container image HOST-SIDE in PrepareVenue: HostBuild("overlay") runs the
// core prep+resolve seam (charly/build_overlay.go) + the candy renders the overlay Containerfile
// in its OWN code (deploykit.OCITarget walker + the "step-emit"/"oci-emit-step" per-step dispatch
// — the former in-core render DISSOLVED into the candy by P11c), then runs podman build + the
// alias tag via the served executor. The bed runner / `charly start` then configs + starts the
// container. So there is NO per-step venue walk for pod: this plugin's Invoke
// does NOT call kit.WalkPlans — walking the add_candy steps on the host venue would be
// WRONG (they are already baked into the overlay image host-side). It returns an EMPTY
// DeployReply (no teardown reverse ops — pod teardown is `charly remove` + drop overlay
// images, owned by the host lifecycle hook's PostTeardown), keyed by the deploy name.
//
// The plugin exists to serve deploy:pod out-of-process (the uniform substrate model: pod
// is external like local/vm/android/kubernetes) and to acknowledge the Invoke; the real work
// (overlay build + container lifecycle) is the host's, exactly as the vm lifecycle hook
// owns the VM build+boot while plugin-deploy-vm owns only the plan walk.
//
// Dual-placement by construction: the SAME NewProvider()/NewMeta() compile INTO charly
// in-process when listed in compiled_plugins, or cmd/serve serves them OUT-OF-PROCESS over
// go-plugin gRPC when they are not — placement is invisible above the registry.
